# Problem 1

*The function `parent.env()` returns the parent environment of an input
environment, and if `env` is an environment, then `ls(envir = env)` returns a
character vector listing all objects in the environment. Write a function
`ls_ancestors()` that takes an environment `envir` as an input and returns all
object names not just in the input environment but all ancestor environments
too. (Hint: your function should use a `while` loop that terminates when it
reaches the ultimate ancestor of all environments: the empty environment, the
only environment without an ancestor.) **BEWARE: IF YOUR CODE TAKES LONGER THAN
10 SECONDS TO RUN, YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE CREDIT!***

```{r, error = TRUE}
ls_ancestors <- function(envir) {
  envList <- c()
  while (!identical(envir, emptyenv())) {
    envList <- c(envList, ls(envir = envir))
    envir <- parent.env(envir)
  }
  return(envList)
}
```

# Problem 2

*The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence $f_n$ such that $f_1 = 1$, $f_2 = 1$, and
for all $n \geq 3$,*

$$f_n = f_{n - 1} + f_{n - 2}.$$

*Write a function that returns a closure that produces the next element of the
Fibonacci sequence every time is called, with the exception of the first two
terms. Call the function returning the closure `fib_gen()`.*

```{r, error = TRUE}
fib_gen <- function(f1 = 1, f2 = 1) {  # Could choose different sequence inits
  f1 + f2
  function() {
    ftemp <- f2
    f2 <<- f1 + f2
    f1 <<- ftemp
    f2
  }
}
```

*The following code will be used to test that `fib_gen()` works as intended.*

```{r, error = TRUE}
# Test code; DO NOT EDIT!
f <- fib_gen()
f()  # Should be 2
f()  # Should be 3
f()  # Should be 5
f()  # Should be 8
f()  # Should be 13
```

# Problem 3

*Consider the problem of plotting and minimizing the sum of square errors
presented in the lecture. The **sum of absolute errors (SAE)** can be
similarly defined as:*

$$SAE(\theta) = \sum_{i=1}^n \left|x_i - \theta \right|.$$

*Handle $SAE(\theta)$ like $SSE(\theta)$ was handled in the lecture by writing a
function that returns closures representing $SAE(\theta)$ for input data sets.
Demonstrate your function works by:*

1. *Generating a random data set using `rnorm()` with a mean of $\mu=10$;*
2. *Plotting $SAE(\theta)$ for the data set in the neighborhood of $\theta =
   10$; and*
3. *Minimizing $SAE(\theta)$ with `optimize()`.*

*Compare the results of `optimize()` with the median of your data set.
(Theoretically, it can be shown that the $\theta$ that minimizes $SAE(\theta)$
is the sample median; however, this* cannot *be shown using simple calculus
since $SAE(\theta)$ is not differentiable in $\theta$ everywhere. For this
reason as well, `optimize()` does not work well since the numerical procedure
requires the input function being minimized also be differentiable.)*

```{r, error = TRUE}
sae_computer <- function(x) {
  f <- function(t) {
  if (!is.numeric(t) || length(t) > 1) 
    stop("Invalid t")
  sum(abs(x - t))
  }
  Vectorize(f)
}
x <- rnorm(40, mean = 10)
sae <- sse_computer(x)

#Now we'll graph and compare with optimize.
curve(sae, 6, 14)

optimize(sae, c(-100, 100))
```

# Problem 4

*Recall the bootstrapping procedure, where one resamples from the original data
set, with replacement, to produce new data sets on which statistics can be
computed. Write a function `bootstrap_gen()` that returns closures that produce
bootstrap replicates of an input data set. Use this function to produce
bootstrap confidence intervals for the mean of the following data set `dat`.*

```{r, error = TRUE}
dat <- c(1.2, 2.1, 0.3, 8.7, 4.4, 5.4)  # DO NOT EDIT
bootstrap_gen <- function(x) {
  function() {
    sample(x, size = length(x), replace = TRUE)
  }
}
#Now use the function to produce confidence intervals for the mean.
f <- bootstrap_gen(dat)
mean_boot <- replicate(1000, {
     mean(f())
 })
  quantile(mean_boot, c(0.025, 0.975))
```

# Problem 5

*Write a function `multiply<-()` that can be used to multiply a selected element
in the numeric vector supplied to the function by the amount listed to the right
of the assignment operator.*

```{r, error = TRUE}
`multiply<-` <- function(x, pos = 1, value) {
  x[pos] = x[pos] * value
  return(x)
}
```

*The following will be used to test that your function works properly:*

```{r, error = TRUE}
# Test code; DO NOT EDIT!
vec <- 1:10
multiply(vec) <- 2
multiply(vec, 3) <- 10
vec  # vec[1] should be 2 and vec[3] should be 30
```
