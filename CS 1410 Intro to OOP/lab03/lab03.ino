/* Lab #3
 *
 * The code is a state machine that will turn on three LEDs in sequence,
 * then turn them off in the same sequence.
 *
 * Pin assignment:
 *    First LED output:  pin 2 (digital 2)
 *    Second LED output: pin 3 (digital 3)
 *    Third LED output:  pin 4 (digital 4)
 *
 *    Analog input:     pin A0 (analog in 0)
 *    Digital input:     pin 8  (digital 8)
 *
 * Students will add:
 *    Code to read an analog input and adjust a delay
 *    Code to read a digital input and start / stop the animation
 *
 * Based on Chad Hokama's solution, updated by Peter Jensen 9/2/2019
